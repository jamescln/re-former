# Odin Project Ruby on Rails Form Assignment.

This is a part of the Forms Project from the Odin Project's Ruby on Rails course.
The lesson can be found at the following link: [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-forms)

## First Step

The first part of this project is to create a form in HTML and a rails backend that can process the
form and add the information to a database. This section will later be refactored to include the
form_with method rather that using a HTML form but this has helped solidify my understanding
of how rails interacts with forms and authentication tokens.

## Second Step

The second step involves replacing the HTML tags with rails form tags. This should help me learn about
how to deal with legacy codebases should I come across them.
